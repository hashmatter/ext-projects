# Abstract

Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) are an important building block for the decentralized web and P2P systems. DHTs are overlay networks that allow peers to store and lookup data stored in a decentralized network, where participating nodes are collaborate on routing the network requests and storing data. Although collaboration between peers in the network is essential for providing a decentralized and scalable service, naive network designs leak user behavior information and metadata to other network participants. In particular, adversaries are able to learn insights about who is participating in the network, who is requesting a particular set of data, who is storing and providing a particular set of data and what are the relations between users in the network. The data leaked by users in DHTs pose a serious threat to individual and community privacy and can be used to target and censor individuals, communities and services.
